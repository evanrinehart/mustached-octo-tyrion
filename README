Setup Instructions

`bundle install' to get the gems listed in the Gemfile. It uses sqlite as the
database so you do not need to set up MySQL users or anything.

`rake test' to run the tests of the API.




API

GET /activities/{activity_id}/available_days
  ?start_date={yyyy-mm-dd}
  &end_date={yyyy-mm-dd}

Responds with a JSON array of dates of availability for the requested activity
within the requested date range. The dates are strings of the form yyyy-mm-dd.


GET /activities/{activity_id}/available_times?date={yyyy-mm-dd}

Respond with a JSON array of start times for the activity on that day. The
times are in the form HH:MM:SS.


POST /activities/{activity_id}/instances
post body example:
  {
    'date':         '2014-05-04',
    'time':         '13:30:00',
    'minutes_long': 30,
    'price':        40,
    'max_bookings': 9
  }

Create a new individual instance for the activity at the specified date and
time. Duration price and capacity must be specified as above. A 400 will happen
if this overlaps an existing instance. Nothing is returned with a 200.


POST /activities/{activity_id}/schedule/recurring
post body example 1:
  {
    'strategy':'weekly',
    'days':[1,3,5],
    'times':[9,14],
    'price':100,
    'max_bookings':10,
    'minutes_long':90
  }

post body example 2:
  {'strategy':'prime_days'}

Install a recurring availability schedule for this activity. The required
parameters depend on the chosen strategy, which must come from a set of allowed
codes. A 400 occurs if, after clearing the current schedule, but leaving any
instances with bookings, the schedule would cause an overlap. In case of a 400
nothing happens. On 200 nothing is returned.

The strategy argument determines what other arguments are required. Each would
have it's own documentation. PrimeDays is a toy strategy to demonstrate
an alternative rule: one availability occurs on prime numbered days at 7PM
(hour 19), and allows no configurability.


DELETE /activities/{activity_id}/instances/{instance_id}

To specify an instance_id, use the start date and time in the format:
  YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:00

Cancel the specified activity instance. 400 will happen if there are any
bookings for that instance. If you cancel a (empty) recurring instance then it
also cancels the entire recurrence schedule, except for currently existing
booked instances.


POST /activities/{activity_id}/schedule/clear

Cancel all (empty) instances of the specified activity including recurring
ones. No post body is expected. Nothing is returned with a 200.



POST /activities/{activity_id}/instances/{instance_id}/bookings
post body example:
  {'user_id':'u9999'}

To specify an instance_id, use the start date and time in the format:
  YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:00

Create a new booking for a particular activity instance. 400 will happen
if there is no more room. The user_id must be provided. JSON of the form
{'booking_id':NNNN} will be returned on a 200.
 

DELETE /activities/{activity_id}/instances/{instance_id}/bookings/#{booking_id}

To specify an instance_id, use the start date and time in the format:
  YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:00

Cancel the specified booking.
